# Wizardly Whispers

This project is a real-time chat application based on the group discussions that take place in different houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the Harry Potter series. The application allows users to login or signup if they are new and then join the conversation of the house they are allocated.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account or login if they already have one.
- **Real-time Chat:** Users can participate in real-time group discussions with other members of their allocated house.
- **House-specific Conversations:** Each house has its own chatroom, where only members of that house can participate.
- **Usernames:** Users can see the name of other members who are in the same house as them.
